Introduction: For this report I will be analyzing location data from both New York and Toronto to determine neighborhoods that are most similar between these two cities. This would be useful for individuals who are moving from one city to the other find a neighborhood that is most similar to their current neighborhood. While only New York and Toronto will be studied in this project, the functionality of this program can be adapted to other cities as well to create an application that helps users move between cities more comfortably by suggesting neighborhoods in their new city that they would be most comfortable living in.
