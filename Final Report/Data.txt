Data: I will be using Foursquare location data for neighborhoods in New York and Toronto for this project, as well as publicly available neighborhood data for the two cities from either Wikipedia (Toronto) or provided by Coursera (New York). Specifically, I will correlate each neighborhood in these two cities with their latitude and longitude values. I will then use these values with the Foursquare API to get relevant information on venues in each neighborhood. With a dataframe containing the number of each venue type in each neighborhood in each city, I will perform k-means clustering on the neighborhoods in both cities. This will give k different groups containing neighborhoods from both New York and Toronto, so it can be assumed that neighborhoods in each group share similar characteristics regardless of the city in which they are located.
