Results: The algorithm described in the methodology section produces a large dataset of all the neighborhoods in both New York and Toronto. This dataset can be easily divided based on cluster label to get five subsets of the whole dataset. Each of the neighborhoods in each subset is similar to the other neighborhoods in the subset, so a person looking to move would most likely want to move to a neighborhood grouped in the same subset as their current neighborhood.Discussion: The full implementation this algorithm would require some additional work, but everything can be easily done on the resulting dataset with cluster labels. The user would first find the label associated with their neighborhood by searching for their neighborhood within the dataset. Then the user would search for all neighborhoods with the same cluster label as their own neighborhood and that are located in the city other than their own. This would give them all neighborhoods in the other city that were identified as relatively similar to their own, hopefully facilitating their move to a new city.Conclusion: In conclusion, clustering the neighborhood data from two cities in this way makes it easy to similarities to be drawn between neighborhoods across cities. While only New York and Toronto were studied in this project, it would be relatively easy to extend the functionality of this algorithm to other cities as well. In order to do this, neighborhood data from these additional cities would need to be collected, either using a web scraper or from a centralized database. Once this data has been collected, it can be processed in a similar manner to the New York and Toronto data in this project.
