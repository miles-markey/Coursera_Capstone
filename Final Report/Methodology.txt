Methodology: To analyze the similarity of neighborhoods in both New York and Toronto, the first step was to import the data corresponding to the different neighborhoods in these two cities. For Toronto, the web scraper developed in week three was used to create a dataframe that contained all the postal codes, boroughs and neighborhoods in the city. Then the given ‘Geospatial coordinates.csv’ file was used to assign a latitude and longitude value to each neighborhood. For New York, this data was available from the week three lab. Next a function to get all the venues in a given neighborhood was defined using the Foursquare API, and was used to get all the venues corresponding to each neighborhood in both cities. These two dataframes were then combined and a column was added to identify the city each neighborhood was located in. Finally, k-means clustering was performed on the combined dataset to identify similar neighborhoods in both cities. This will allow users to find neighborhoods similar to their own in a new city.
